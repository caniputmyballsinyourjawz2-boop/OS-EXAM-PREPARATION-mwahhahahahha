Functions requirement and shi:
INstruction - Program to create is 1 code that consist of functions like SJT, SRTF, ROUND ROBIN
Modular will accept either vector or array

4th Function - Recommended Quantum Time 

ROundRobin does the Quantum time

median or mean typshi

Data structure
inside the process to a data type named process and inside that process (ID) has that AT, BT, TT, WT, CT supposed to be inside that structure. 

Main Function
call other function outside, we not gonna input, the data should be declared.

if we run this code, it would calculate the recommended quantum time, and it will display the following algorithm IN ORDER SJT SRTF RR

it will create a table with Process ID (PID), ARrival time, burst time, completion time, turnaround time and waiting time. 

This SHIT will happen THREE TIME ON ALL 3 SCHEDULING ALGORITHM

AND BELOW THOSE TABLE IT WILL HAVE AVERAGE WAITING TIME AND AVERAGE TURNAROUND TIME

ON BELOW ON EACH TABLE.

THe values of the process.

Arrival time:
1
3
8
4
6
7
2
5

Burst time
53
43
18
16
24
73
99
27


acronym of the id only ah for the data.

the following order shall be shown
SFT

SRTF

ROUND ROBIN

THE RECOMMENDED QUANTUM TIME ONLY IN FUCKING ROUND ROBIN OKAY?! IT WILL ONLY BE SHOWN THERE.

ideal option for recommended quantum time, median or mean.
